# ASP.NET final project

The website(team seeker) contains two type of users including people who wants to find team member(leader) and people who wants to find a team to work with(seeker). The peoject that leader posted could be anything as small as moving a house as big as building an UFO.

Users are able to sign up as either leader or seeker, in order to find team or project. As a leader, user basically post project description including time, location, number of team members needed and salary avaliablity. In other words, the leader can find team members on our website. Leaders submit their blueprint on the website. He could say how much money/ stock he wanna pay or share or maybe it just an unpaid project. Also leaders are able to delete their posted project. 
For the seeker, he could participate in as an volunteer, or co-founder based on his wish or  contribution. When a new project posted, seekers are able to add their name on the waiting list as well as delete their name on waiting list, and wait for leaders making final decision.
